# EEPROM_CODE :

This code is for OpenComputers (OpenComputers is a Minecraft mod)<br>
It's a little BIOS inspired by youareanidiot.org<br>
Made by OyoPlayer (minecraft username)</br><br>

## Installation:
To install the bios with OpenOS, run this command (need an internet card):
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oyo-Player/OC-you-are-an-idiot-bios/main/eeprom_code.lua /tmp/eeprom_code.lua && flash -q /tmp/eeprom_code.lua && reboot
```
Or: `pastebin run bVDFEe6R`

</br>If you don't have an internet card, copy the code and paste it a file and then run this command ([file-name] is the name you gave to the file):
`flash -q [file-name]`

# other things
- Also I'm not a very good at programming BIOS, so there will probably be some issues.<br>
- There will probably be some updates for some days but I'll not work a lot on this project. This project has been made only for fun.<br>
- Here is a video showing what the BIOS does: https://youtu.be/rtAsAZ80bgE
